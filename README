The program epsonps converts epson printer codes from an input file 
to PostScript. It is an excellent ASCII listing printer.
Command line options are provided for auto linefeed, auto carriage return, 
condensed mode, elite mode, output file name, IBM screen dump mode 
and paper type selection.

It is written in C and will compile and run on MS-DOS and Unix.  
A Unix makefile is provided.  
To compile for MS-DOS see the comments in the Unix makefile.

All Epson LX-800 and Star NL-10 codes are recognised except
    1: Download characters <ESC> %, <ESC> &
    2: Alignment <ESC> a
    3: Proportional printing <ESC> p
Most Epson LQ-800 printer codes are recognised.

I have expanded the program and renamed it epsonps.c.
The copyright message still applies.

Program resurrected in early 2016 by Chris Kobayashi <chris@disavowed.jp>
The copyright message still applies.  The only difference made to date
(22 April 2016) is the return of input/output pipe support.
